# PostHog Plugin: Hello World Starter Kit

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-red.svg?style=flat-square)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This is a basic exemplary PostHog plugin. It adds property `"greeting"` to every event, with a configurable value (default: `"Hello world!"`).

Feel free to use it as a base for your own plugins!

## How to develop

All of the plugin's code is located in the `index.js` file, which is JavaScript ran inside of PostHog.
To get yourself up to speed with this environment, we sincerely recommend checking out our [Plugins overview in PostHog Docs](https://posthog.com/docs/plugins/build/overview).
For a crash course, read our [plugin building tutorial in PostHog Docs](https://posthog.com/docs/plugins/build/tutorial).

## How to test

To test the plugin, you'll need to install a few `npm` dependencies already specified in `package.json`:
```bash
npm install
```

This will get you the testing library Jest and some our test helpers.
Then to run tests it's just:

```bash
npm test
```
